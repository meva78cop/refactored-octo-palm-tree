# Find title of song that is on your mind
building AI course project
## Summary
It is iritating to have a piece of a melody or a song on you mind and not knowing the title ,the artist, date of release etc.
I want to make an AI based recognition system to find the rest of the song or melody. You just tap on the microfon (beat), or sing (or just make some noise that remind you of that song if you can not remember the words) and the AI method comes up whith the song or songs that resembles best.
## Background
having a piece of a song in ones head whithout knowing where it comes from is a very common little problem that many people have from time to time, so why dont solve it.
## How is it used?
An example, lets say I have speculated the whole week about a melody: na na na na  nanana, I tried to ask people what is the name of the song but nobody can help. So I open my smartphone and sing na na na na nanana, and it imidately come up with a solution. Its from 'The ghostbusters'.
## Data sources and AI methods
I would of course need a big library with music. Then I would compare the music i was thiking about with a song from the library. Fitst from the beginning, then I would move my song one tenth of a second forward and compare again then do it again and again until the song I was thinking about would end at the same time as the song in the library. The I would compare my song the same way to every song in my library.
Then I would use the nearest nighbour qualifier method to choose the song that fit best. After gathering data from users I could use them too in my algorithm, in a similar way like a content recomendation system does.
## What next?
Maybe and only maybe it coud become part of a big tech company like facebook or google instead of just be an independent app. google f.eks. has many other functions other than beeing a search engine, f.eks. showing how to pronaunce words.
